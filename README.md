How to Win: get rid of every card a player holds

How to play: 
	Dealing- distribution of cards depends on the number of players in the game. theres allowed 2 to 6 players. if there are 2 
	then they are dealt 10 each, if 3-4 then 7, if 5 or 6 then each person gets six cards. The rest of the deck is put face down 
	to creat the stock pile except for the first card on that pile which be left face up next to the stock pile to make the 
	discard pile.
	
	Playing- There are three ways to get rid of your cards
		1.) Melding - These are combinations of cards from your deck. There are 2 kinds of malds that can be created
			a.) sequence/run - 3 or more cards of the same suit in order of their values
			b.) group/set/book - 3 or 4 cards of the same value 
		2.) Laying off - contribute some of your cards to an already made meld by continuing the order that was already established.
		3.) Discarding - putting one of your cards on top of the discard pile. This can be done once per turn.

The player that gets rid of all their cards wins first place, the other players determine their placement by finding the sum of the 
value of the cards they hold.

The value of face cards(Queens, jacks, and kings) equal ten. Aces equal 1 and the other's values correspond to the number on the card.
